Generalised Data Structures Library
ProjectName : Created self data structures.

Technology: C++ Programming

Author: Sakshi Pankaj Borhade

Project Overview
This project is a C++ library of generic data structures that provides object-oriented implementations of both linear and non-linear data structures.

It offers ready-to-use functionalities for both fundamental and advanced operations. The library is designed using templates so that it can be reused with any data type.

The implementation follows OOP principles such as encapsulation, modularity, and extensibility, making it suitable for both academic learning and real-world application development.

Key Features
Linear Data Structures:

Singly Linear Linked List
Singly Circular Linked List
Doubly Linear Linked List
Doubly Circular Linked List
Stack (LIFO)
Queue (FIFO)
Non-Linear Data Structures:

Binary Search Tree (BST) with insert, delete, and traversal operations
Algorithms:

Searching: Linear Search, Binary Search
Sorting: Bubble Sort, Efficient Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort
Generic Implementation:

Uses C++ templates for type independence
Same implementation works for integers, floats, strings, and custom objects
Library Format:

Designed as a reusable C++ library that can be linked with client applications
Learning Outcomes
Mastery of C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
Strong foundation in linear and non-linear data structures
Implementation of generic programming with templates
Practical knowledge of searching and sorting algorithms
Experience in designing reusable libraries for software development
Motivation & Problem Statement
Every computer science student and software developer repeatedly needs to implement and use data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and sorting/searching algorithms.

While C++ already provides the STL (Standard Template Library), many learners find it difficult to understand because of its abstract syntax and lack of visibility into internal implementations.

Thus, this project solves two main problems:

Educational Purpose â†’ Helping learners understand the internal working of data structures by implementing them from scratch.

Practical Purpose â†’ Providing a reusable, generic library that can be easily linked with other projects (like STL).
